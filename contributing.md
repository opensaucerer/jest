### Build for the public and the public will build you!

There are a lot of things still missing in this framework and you can help contribute to their development. Here are some of the ones I could come up with.

### Milestones

- [x] Implement basic test runner functionality
- [x] Implement basic assertion functionalities
- [x] Add support for `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks
- [x] Allow asynchronous tests
- [ ] Add support for `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks
- [ ] Add support for `describe` blocks
- [ ] Add support for `it` blocks
- [ ] Allow for more complex assertions
- [ ] Implement a CLI command for running tests
- [ ] Compile code into an npm package

Contributing is as easy as opening an issue and creating a pull request.

But first, to create a pull request you need to create a fork of the main branch and then clone the forked repository to your local.
For example, here's how you clone this repository...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opensaucerer/pest.git
```

Then checkout to a new branch with a name to describe the feature or fix you intend to make. For example

```bash
git checkout -b feat/support-beforeEach-and-afterEach
```

Now, modify the code in this new branch and include tests for your changes then open a pull requests against the `main` branch. Please make sure that all tests pass before opening a pull request.

Thank you as you contribute.
